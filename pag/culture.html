            <h2>Amazing Jordanian Culture</h2>
            <p>Here we will talk about Jordan's Culture</p>
            <div class="clearfix">
                <p style="clear:right">The culture of Jordan is based in Arabic and Islamic elements. Jordan stands at
                    the intersection of
                    the three continents of the ancient world, lending it geographic and population diversity. Notable
                    aspects of the culture include traditional music and clothing of Jordan, and interest in sports.</p>

                     alt="jordan culture">
                <p>
                    Archeological evidence indicates that the area of Jordan was occupied by settlers as early as 7000
                    BC, which makes it home to captivating historical and biblical sites. Jordan offers a variety of
                    wonders, from vast desert, to the Dead Sea, to the ancient city of Petra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jordanians typically respect those who are kind, friendly, and hospitable. They are generally
                    socially conservative; family values and honor are fiercely protected. Jordanians are proud of their
                    rich cultural heritage.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <div>
                    <span> <h2>Social interactions</h2></span>

                    <p>Social interaction in Jordan is replete with all kinds of seemingly impenetrable verbal and
                        behavioural
                        rituals, most of which can remain unaddressed by foreigners with impunity. A few things are
                        worth
                        knowing, however.</p>

                    <p>The energy which Jordanians put into social relationships can bring shame to westerners used to
                        keeping
                        a distance. Total strangers greet each other like chums and chat happily about nothing special,
                        passers-by ask each other’s advice or exchange opinions without a second thought, and old
                        friends embark
                        on volleys of salutations and cheek-kisses, joyful arm-squeezing or back-slapping, and earnest
                        enquiries
                        after health, family, business and news. Foreigners more used to avoiding strangers and doing
                        business
                        in shops quickly and impersonally can come across as cold, uninterested and even snooty.
                        Smiling,
                        learning one or two of the standard forms of greeting, acknowledging those who are welcoming you
                        and
                        taking the time to exchange pleasantries will bring you closer to people more quickly than
                        anything
                        else.</p>


                    <p> People shake hands in Jordan much more than in the West, and even the merest contact with a
                        stranger is
                        normally punctuated by at least one or two handshakes to indicate fraternity.</p>

        <article>
            <h2>Personal space</h2><br>
            <p>Personal space is treated rather differently in Arab cultures from in the West: for all intents and
                purposes, it doesn’t exist. Queuing is a foreign notion, and in many situations hanging back
                deferentially is an invitation for other people to move in front. Jordanians also relate to the natural
                environment rather differently from westerners. Sitting alone or with a friend in the most perfectly
                tranquil spot, you may find someone coming up to you blocking the sunset and eager for a chat. It can be
                difficult, if not impossible, to convey your desire to be alone.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Invitations</h2><br>
            <p>It’s almost inevitable that during your time in Jordan you’ll be invited to drink tea with someone,
                either in their shop or their home. It’s quite likely too that at some point you’ll be invited for a
                full meal at someone’s house. Jordanians take hospitality very much to heart, and are honestly
                interested in talking to you and making you feel comfortable. However, offers tend to flow so thick and
                fast that it would be difficult to agree to everyone, yet people are often so eager it can also be
                difficult – and potentially rude – to refuse outright.</p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, whether you’re interested or not, is to take the time to chat civilly; nothing is
                more offensive than walking on without a word or making an impatient gesture, even if they’re the
                twentieth person that day to stop you. If you’re invited and you don’t want to accept, a broad smile
                with your head lowered, your right hand over your heart and “shukran shukran” (“thank you, thank you”)
                is a clear, but socially acceptable, no. You may have to do this several times – it’s all part of the
                social ritual of polite insistence. Adding “marra okhra, insha’allah” (“another time, if God wills it”)
                softens the “no” still further, indicating that you won’t forget their kind offer.
            </p>

                        <p>is marked by deposits at the base of Dhībān. Although many sites have been found in the
                            northern portion of the country, few have been excavated, and little evidence of settlement
                            in this period is found south of Al-Shawbak. The region’s early Bronze Age culture was
                            terminated by a nomadic invasion that destroyed the principal towns and villages, marking
                            the end of an apparently peaceful period of development. Security was not reestablished
                            until the Egyptians arrived after 1580 BC. It was once believed that the area was unoccupied
                            from 1900 to 1300 BC, but a systematic archaeological survey has shown that the country had
                            a settled population throughout the period. This was confirmed by the discovery of a small
                            temple at Amman with Egyptian, Mycenaean, and Cypriot imported objects. </p>

                        <h3>The Latin kingdom and Muslim domination</h3>
                        <p>The area was devastated in the 6th and 7th centuries by the intermittent warfare between
                            Byzantium and Sāsānian Persia. In 627 the emperor Heraclius finally defeated the Persians
                            and reestablished order, but Byzantium, gravely weakened by the long struggle, was unable to
                            face the unexpected menace of a new power that had arisen in Arabia. In 636 the Muslims—led
                            by the famous “Sword of Islam,” Khālid ibn al-Walīd—destroyed a Byzantine army at the Battle
                            of the Yarmūk River and brought the greater part of Syria and Palestine under Muslim
                            rule.</p>

                        <h3>Capital at Damascus</h3>
                        <p>The caliphs of the Umayyad dynasty (660–750) established their capital at Damascus and built
                            hunting lodges and palaces in the Jordanian desert. These can still be seen at sites such as
                            Qaṣr ʿAmrah, Al-Kharānah, Al-Ṭūbah, and Qaṣr al-Mushattā. Many Roman forts were also
                            rebuilt. After the ʿAbbāsids seized power in 750, the capital was transferred to Baghdad,
                            and Syria, which had been the Umayyad metropolitan province, was severely repressed. Jordan,
                            now distant from the centre of power, became a backwater and slowly returned to the old
                            Bedouin way of life. With the capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099, the Latin
                            kingdom of Jerusalem was extended east of the Jordan, a principality known as Oultre
                            Jourdain was established, and a capital was set up at Al-Karak. After the Crusaders
                            retreated, the history of Jordan remained mostly uneventful. Not until the 16th century did
                            it submit to Ottoman rule and become part of the vilāyet (province) of Damascus. </p>

                        <h3>Transjordan, the Hāshimite Kingdom, and the Palestine war</h3>
                        <p>During World War I the Arabs joined the British against the Ottomans. In a revolt of 1916, in
                            which they were assisted by Colonel T.E. Lawrence, the Arabs severed the Hejaz Railway. In
                            July 1917 the army of Prince Fayṣal ibn Husayn (of the Hāshimite [or Hashemite] dynasty)
                            captured Al-ʿAqabah, and by October 1918 Amman and Damascus were in Allied hands. In 1920
                            the Conference of San Remo in Italy created two mandates; one, over Palestine, was given to
                            Great Britain, and the other, over Syria, went to France. This act effectively separated the
                            area now occupied by Israel and Jordan from that of Syria. In November 1920 ʿAbdullāh,
                            Fayṣal’s brother, arrived in Maʿān (then part of the Hejaz) with 2,000 armed supporters
                            intent on gathering together tribes to attack the French, who had forced Fayṣal to
                            relinquish his newly founded kingdom in Syria. By April 1921, however, the British had
                            decided that ʿAbdullāh would take over as ruler of what then became known as
                            Transjordan. </p>

                        <h3>Full independence</h3>
                        <p>Effectively, Turkish rule in Transjordan was simply replaced by British rule. The mandate,
                            confirmed by the League of Nations in July 1922, gave the British virtually a free hand in
                            administering the territory. However, in September, the establishment of “a Jewish national
                            home” was explicitly excluded from the mandate’s clauses, and it was made clear that the
                            area would also be closed to Jewish immigration. On May 25, 1923, the British recognized
                            Transjordan’s independence under the rule of Emir ʿAbdullāh, but, as outlined in a treaty as
                            well as the constitution in 1928, matters of finance, military, and foreign affairs would
                            remain in the hands of a British “resident.” Full independence was finally achieved after
                            World War II by a treaty concluded in London on March 22, 1946, and ʿAbdullāh subsequently
                            proclaimed himself king. </p>

                        <h3>Jordan under King Ḥussein</h3>
                        <p>The history of Jordan after 1953 was largely shaped by King Ḥussein’s policies to secure his
                            throne and to retain or regain the West Bank for the Hāshimite dynasty. Jordan’s
                            relationship with Israel in the first decade of the Jewish state’s existence was uneasy but
                            tolerable, though bloody raids and acts of terrorism carried out by both sides added to the
                            tension. Jordan’s involvement in the Palestinian question led as much to a contest with
                            Egypt over Jordan’s future as it did to a struggle with Israel. In particular, it repeatedly
                            forced Jordan to balance relations with and between various Arab nations, the Palestinians,
                            and the West and Israel. Thus, popular demonstrations, especially in the West Bank, and
                            pressure from Egypt prevented Ḥussein in 1955 from signing the Baghdad Pact, a pro-Western
                            mutual defense treaty that he had initiated between Great Britain, Turkey, Iran, and Iraq.
                            The next year Ḥussein—bowing to popular pressure and in a show of support for Egyptian
                            efforts at pan-Arab leadership—dismissed his British advisers, including Glubb, and
                            abrogated the Anglo-Jordanian treaty of 1946. However, when members of the National Guard,
                            drawn mainly from the West Bank, attempted a coup in April 1957, the king, supported by
                            loyal East Bank Bedouins, purged the legislature of Palestinian nationalists and extremists,
                            banned political parties, and set up a royal dictatorship to curb domestic unrest. </p>

                        <h3>The PLO and the June 1967 war</h3>
                        <p>The emergence in the late 1960s of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the
                            militant group Fatah represented a potential threat to Jordan’s sovereignty in the West Bank
                            as well as to Israel. In early 1965, with the support of Egypt and the radical Baʿth Party
                            government in Syria, Fatah began a series of Jordan-based raids against Israel that
                            inflicted serious casualties and property damage. Israel retaliated by raiding the West Bank
                            in an effort to deter these operations. Relations between Jordan and Syria and Egypt and
                            between the Palestinians and Amman soon deteriorated. Ḥussein continued private talks with
                            Israel over the internal and external dangers both countries faced. In late 1966 the Israeli
                            army made a devastating raid into the West Bank village of Al-Samu south of Hebron. Ḥussein
                            responded by attempting to stop the passage of Syrian-based Palestinian guerrillas coming
                            through Jordan into Israel, and he eventually broke off diplomatic ties with Syria. However,
                            as tension mounted between Israel and Egypt and Syria in the spring of 1967, Jordan reversed
                            its position and signed a defense pact with Egypt and Syria. Israeli and Jordanian forces
                            clashed in East Jerusalem, and in June 1967 Ḥussein joined Egypt and Syria in the third
                            Arab-Israeli war. </p>

                        <p>Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 and the subsequent Persian Gulf War (fought
                            principally in January–February 1991) forced Ḥussein to choose between two allies, the
                            United States and Iraq. The king leaned heavily toward Iraqi leader Ṣaddām Ḥussein, who also
                            received a zealous and vocal groundswell of support from the Jordanian people. In addition,
                            trade with Iraq represented two-fifths of the kingdom’s gross domestic product. Kuwait’s
                            allies immediately cut off all aid to Jordan, imposed an air and sea blockade, and condemned
                            King Ḥussein’s actions. To make matters worse, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees from
                            Kuwait were expelled or fled (back) to Jordan. However, by the end of 1991 the United States
                            and Israel were again seeking Ḥussein’s support for an American-Israeli peace
                            initiative. </p>

                        <h3>Arab Spring and reform</h3>
                        <p>After several years of strong economic growth, the global economic recession in 2008–09
                            caused growth to slow in Jordan. In January 2011, following massive antigovernment
                            demonstrations in Tunisia and Egypt (see Arab Spring), thousands of Jordanians attended
                            rallies in Amman to protest high prices, unemployment, public corruption, and a lack of
                            democracy in Jordan. The crowds focused much of their anger on Jordan’s prime minister,
                            Samir Rifai, and his government rather than on the king. The government responded to that
                            popular discontent by announcing a package of subsidies for basic goods, but that did little
                            to placate critics, and protests continued. On February 1 King ʿAbdullāh dismissed the
                            government and appointed a new prime minister, Marouf al-Bakhit. In an official statement
                            the king tasked Bakhit with introducing political reforms and improving living conditions
                            for all Jordanians. </p>

                        <h3>Continued reform and austerity</h3>
                        <p>Electoral reform was again implemented in 2016, this time introducing a system of
                            proportional representation. The IAF participated in the election for the first time in over
                            a decade. Wary of public perception after years of vilification and nonparticipation, the
                            party formed a political alliance known as the National Coalition for Reform (NCR) that
                            included Christians and non-Islamist Muslims and that avoided campaigning under Islamist
                            slogans. The NCR won only 15 of the 130 parliamentary seats but was the largest organized
                            political group in parliament. The vast majority of seats were won by independent candidates
                            unaffiliated with any party. </p>
                        <p>
                            uided by the IMF and aimed toward reducing public debt and spurring growth. The program
                            required a number of austerity measures in the years that followed. The budget for 2017
                            reduced the deficit largely by raising taxes. Sales tax was increased on many goods in 2018
                            as subsidies for food staples were cut, though low-income individuals would receive cash
                            transfers to offset the subsidy cuts. In late spring, as lawmakers debated a bill to raise
                            income tax by 5 percent, Jordanians took to the streets in the largest protests since 2011.
                            King ʿAbdullāh replaced his prime minister, and the new prime minister rescinded the tax
                            bill. Months later, in November 2018, an amended tax bill was passed that exempted
                            low-income households from the tax, though the amendment did not alleviate all concerns over
                            the tax hike. In 2019 it appeared that the tax hike had backfired, hampering consumption and
                            ultimately causing revenue collected from sales tax to decline. By the end of the year,
                            Jordan had begun negotiations with the IMF to begin a new program to spur growth.
